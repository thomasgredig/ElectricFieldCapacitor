# ElectricFieldCapacitor

In a parallel plate capacitor the electric field $E$ in the center is approximately constant and can be approximated with

$$
E \simeq \frac{Q}{A \epsilon_0}
$$

if the capacitor separation distance $d$ is much smaller than the plate size $\sqrt{A}$. If the plates are not sufficiently close, then the electric field is not constant. 

The problem at hand is a capacitor with 20cm separation and square plates of 30cm length, and area $A$ of 900cm$^2$. If a potential of 1200V is applied what is the potential difference of 16cm in the middle part of the capacitor.

We make a calculation in this particular case, see the code for [ComputeElectricField.R](ComputeElectricField.R).
